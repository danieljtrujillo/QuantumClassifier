# QuantumClassifier
My iteration of the code from Siraj Raval's "Let's Build a Quantum Classifier! LIVE" video

The first 2 code cells are a demonstration of the "Sieve of Eratosthenes" which is an algorithm for calculating prime numbers.

The last 2 code cells install and import Pennylane and run some QML simulated calculations.
